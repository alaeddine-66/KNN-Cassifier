Drawing App README
Overview
This project is a Drawing App built using Python's tkinter library, allowing users to draw and interact with a graphical canvas.
The app performs classification of drawn sketches based on their shape features,
displaying the nearest predicted label from a predefined set of categories. 
It also includes a dynamic graph visualization to help illustrate the classification process.

Features
Drawing Interface: Users can draw freehand on a canvas using the mouse.
Classification: The app analyzes sketches based on geometric features (e.g., width, height, roundness, elongation) 
and predicts the nearest label from a predefined list of objects (e.g., car, fish, house, etc.).
Accuracy Display: Shows the accuracy of the classifier in the side panel.
Graph Visualization: The app includes a graph that dynamically updates to show how new drawings relate to stored samples in terms of classification.
Undo Functionality: Users can undo their most recent drawing action.
